## Overview

This project involves the development of a mobile application using Android Studio, designed to assist users in Slow Deep Breathing (SDB) training through a PPG-based biofeedback system. The system collects physiological signals using Bluno Beetle and Pulse Sensor, which are then analyzed via Firebase to extract meaningful insights.

## How it works

- The user connects the Bluno Beetle to the Pulse Sensor, which measures PPG signals.

- The sensor data is transmitted to the mobile application via wired connection.

- The app processes and visualizes the PPG data while providing biofeedback cues.

- The collected data is sent to Firebase, where it can be analyzed for patterns related to Slow Deep Breathing (SDB) training.
